# Welcome to AI-190199 Project Repository

## Introduction (about me)
A warm welcome from me. This repository is a collection of project I have done in university. I currently a Electronic Engineering student at Anglia Ruskin University. I am a second year student. I decided to take this course as I was quite interested in technology since I
took apart many different things; from old toys to computers, trying to understand why theylooked like a miniature city (I did this a very young age). At the time, I didn't realise what Ihad been doing, I was in fact reverse engineering them. I did this over the course of my childhood, it was this that made me curious to what made them work, because of this it made me want build and design them. When I think about electronics I see a future where we can prosper, where we can connect with each other, and where technology will be a the fore front in helping and assisting humanity to a greater existence. By studying this subject, I feel that this will be a fulfilling contribution to the future generations to come, and hope to inspire newer generations to the same commitment. This why I am looking for newer opportunities to further my career, satisfy my personal goals. I believe this takes time and commitment.
