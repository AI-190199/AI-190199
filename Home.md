# Welcome to AI-190199 Project Repository
A warm welcome from me.
## Introduction (about me)
I currently an Electronic Engineering student at Anglia Ruskin University. I am a second-year student. This repository is a collection of the project created thoughout my studies. I decided to take this course as I was quite interested in technology since I took apart many different things; from old toys to computers, I was reverse-engineering them attempting to understand what makes them works. It was this curiousity that was the foundation of my career, it made me want to build and design them. When I think about electronics I see a future where we can prosper, where we can connect, and where technology will be a the forefront in helping and assisting humanity to a greater existence. By studying this subject, I feel that this will be a fulfilling contribution to future generations to come and hope to inspire newer generations to the same commitment. This why I am looking for newer opportunities to further my career, satisfy my personal goals. I believe this takes time and commitment.
## Final Project - Computer Operated Multicopter utilising 4G in logistics(in Progress)
My Final Project is based on current drone technology, and current mobile communication technology. The purpose was to implement a drone system that can be controlled over the internet. This Iot device was designed for the logistic sector, in which there are situtation where parcels cannot be delivered with conventional methods.
